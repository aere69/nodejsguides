# CLUSTER MODULE

The Cluster Module creates multiple separate Node.js processes, each with its own event loop and memory space.

Each of these processes run independently on **different cores**, utilizing multiple cores for improved performance **(Horizontal Scaling)**.

This operates by creating a master process and several worker processes. The master process manages the distribution of incoming connections among the worker processes. If a worker process fails, the master process can respawn a new one, ensuring robustness in the face of failures.

## Benefits

- **Boost Performance:** Handle higher traffic volumes and improve response times, especially for I/O-bound tasks.
- **Maximize Resource Utilization:** Take advantage of all available cores in your server, significantly increasing processing power.
- **Enhanced Fault Tolerance:** If one worker crashes, others keep the application running, ensuring reliability and uptime.

## Important

- Worker processes share memory and resources, so consider data synchronization carefully.
- The cluster module adds complexity to your application architecture, so evaluate its benefit vs. complexity for your specific needs.

## Use Cases

- **High-Traffic Websites:** When your single-threaded event loop reaches its limits, scaling horizontally with cluster helps manage large user bases efficiently.
- **Long-Running Tasks:** If some requests involve lengthy operations (like image processing or data encryption), distributing them across worker processes improves responsiveness for other requests.
- **When Fault Tolerance is Critical:** For mission-critical applications, the cluster moduleâ€™s resilience to individual process failures offers valuable protection.
