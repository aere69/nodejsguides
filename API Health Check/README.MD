# HEALTH CHECK

Health checks in software identify inefficiencies in our applications allowing us to better maintain them.

Routine health checking of the availability of APIs, for instance, helps you learn of crucial issues and remediate them.

If downtime occurs, the application owner can be informed so that there is a speedy resolution to it.

Health checks become even more important as the infrastructure of our software grows, and the need to make sure that all microservices and endpoints are working flawlessly becomes more vital for the apps we manage.

Some of the things we check when considering the health of software in any programming language or stack are the response time of a server when a request is made and how the server connects to the database (if there is one).

Another reason why a health check is necessary is to maintain the availability of your services.
